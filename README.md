Color Bird is an open-source game developed in Unity, presenting a unique twist on the classic Flappy Bird game. As players navigate the bird through a series of pipes, the background and elements of the game such as pipes and the bird itself undergo vibrant color changes, adding an additional layer of challenge and visual appeal. The game's difficulty increases progressively, requiring players to adapt to changing colors and timing their movements with precision. The open-source nature of the project invites developers and enthusiasts to explore, modify, and enhance the game, fostering a community of creativity and learning around this colorful adaptation.

## Development Highlights
This project serves as a demonstration game for the HandHeld Project, a pioneering initiative we are currently developing. We invite you to stay engaged for further updates as we progress. This endeavor exemplifies our commitment to innovation and excellence in the field. Keep an eye on our developments for more exciting advancements.

## Assets
All visuals utilized within the game are sourced from publicly available assets, specifically curated from https://megacrash.itch.io/flappy-bird-assets. These resources have been selected to ensure both quality and compliance with the open-source nature of our project, allowing for a seamless integration into the game's design. We extend our gratitude to the creators of these assets for their contributions to the community, facilitating creative developments such as ours.
